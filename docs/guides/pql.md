## The Important Pieces

You want to avoid getting too hung up on specific words or insisting on a particular type of approval. Your 
main focus is going to be co-operating with your Loan Officer. 

Not all Lenders have multiple types of approval letters. This might be by choice. 
For instance, while my past employer had the ability to issue a "verified" letter", I rarely used it unless specifically asked by a realtor, client or seller). 
I would call the sellers of the prospective home assuring them of the qualifications 
becuase I had actually done my due diligence

:::tip
This method is only recommended for very knowledgeable Mortgage Professionals. If the lender has an option that 
is stronger, you should opt for it.

## Types of Approvals

These are ranked from weak to strong. 

* Verbal without credit
* Verbal with credit
* Documents provided
* Underwritten ( Reviewed )
* Conditionally Approved

## Verbal

A verbally based qualficiaton letter without a copy of the credit report should be illegal. If a Lender issues 
this, they do not care about your best interests. Most lenders will not write an approval without documents for good
reason. If you are concered about credit, please read TODO

Pre-Qualificaiton (PQL) is the most common term used for a verbal qualificaiton of income and assets with a copy of 
the credit report.

The quality of this letter is <u>highly dependent</u> on the quality of Loan Officer and frowned upon
by most realtors and sellers. There are just too many things that can go wrong. 

**This type of letter might as well be written in crayon by a 5 year old**


## Documents Provided

You've walked through a verbal application and your lender has given you a list of documents to provide.
You send them over, the lender reviews, clarifies any road blocks, and if all is well, issues an Approval letter. 

Typically "approval" means documents have been reviewed. cd ~/Projects/my-website/ && lvim
cd ~/Projects/my-website/ && lvim


Allowing your Loan Officer to review the documents upfront greatly reduces potential problems and **more importantly**
instills confidence in your Loan Officer. 

When it comes time to call a seller or speak with a Realtor, you're LO will be able to say they've reviewed the documents
and they're confident on the loan closing. The is obviously much better than the crayon drawing Pre-Qualification. 

:::tip
Your LO may not have an alternative letter designed ( they require compliance audits and take time to make ) 
However, you should still provide all the necessary documents as the more important part is the LO having them.
