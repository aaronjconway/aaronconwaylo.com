## The Important Pieces

:::note

**tl;dr**

* Don't get too hung up on the words as they vary between lenders. 
* Opt for the highest level of approval, whatever that may be. 
* Having a strong approval isn't just for you. 
:::

Key factors:

* How you are percieved to the seller. Are they concerned about the loan closing? 
* Have you had a thorough enough review to catch any potential issues? 
* Is the Loan Officer confident in my qualifications? 
* Is the Realtor confident in the approval? 

The importantance of these factors will be broken down throughout this article. 

:::tip
In general, if there is an option to get an "upgraded", "verified", or any form of higher level approval, you should opt
for this. It should be free.

## Approval Types 

These are ranked from weakest to strongest. 

* Verbal without credit
* Verbal with credit
* Documents provided
* Underwritten ( Reviewed )
* Conditionally Approved

## Verbal

**A verbally based qualification letter without a copy of the credit report should be illegal.**

If a Lender issues this, they do not care about your best interests. Most lenders will not write an approval 
without documents for good reason. If you are concered about credit, please read [Credit](credit) 

A verbal assesment of your income, assets, with a copy of the credit report is commonly referred to as a 
Pre-Qualification (PQL).

The quality of this letter is <u>highly dependent</u> on the quality of Loan Officer and frowned upon
by most Realtors and sellers. There are just too many things that can go wrong when relying on the conversation
between a loan officer and client. 

**This type of letter might as well be written in crayon by a 5 year old**

## Documents Provided

1. You've had a thoughrough review your loan officer in the form of a 30+ minute conversation and they have given 
you a list of documents to provide.

2. You send them over, the lender reviews, clarifies any road blocks, and if all is well, issues an Approval letter. 

Typically "Pre-Approval" means documents have been reviewed. 

:::caution
Again, this varies between lenders. Rocket Mortgage, for example, provides a Pre-Approval with no documents making it
like most other lenders Pre-Qualification which is weak.
:::

Allowing your Loan Officer to review the documents upfront greatly reduces potential problems and **more importantly**
instills confidence in your Loan Officer. 

### Why This is Better
When it comes time to call a listing agent, you're LO will be able to say they've reviewed the documents
and they're confident on the loan closing. The is obviously much better than the crayon drawing Pre-Qualification. This 
call will typically override any doubts the seller has on the quality of the buyers.  

Additionally, there are plenty of times where problems arise when providing documents that are better to catch up front. 
There are typically resolutions but it's better to solve any issues now before viewing homes. 


:::tip
Your LO may not have an alternative letter designed ( they require compliance audits and take time to make ) 
However, you should still provide all the necessary documents for the reasons stated above.  
:::

## Underwritten

This is the best option if available. 

After providing all the documents your Loan Officer has and underwriter that can sign off on the quality of your approval.

It doesn't guaruntee but it does greatly increase the certainty of the Loan closing. 

:::caution
Some places will use the word guaruntee. Please take this with a grain of salt. Out of personal experience working
with one of these companies, the "gotchas" in the fine print exclude them from honoring the guaruntee. 
:::

## Conditionally Approved

This is quite rare and only provided at certain lenders under certain situations. It is certainly not something 
you should be seeking unless you fall into the follow categories:

* Your employer is relocating you and your lender supports working with a relocation team. 
* You are doing a lock-and-shop program. 

A conditional approval is typically the strongst form of approval minus things that can't be completed till later in the closing
process. 

## Pyschology

Going back to the factors in the begining of this article, your Realtor has to negotiate on your behalf, your loan officer 
may have to convince the listing agent that this is the best offer, and the seller ultimatley wants to know they are 
going to get their money. 

Having a strong approval letter will grant confidence in all parties and increase your chances of closing on the home.
