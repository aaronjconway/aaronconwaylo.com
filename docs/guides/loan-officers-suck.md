title: Why Loan Officers and Realtors Suck
description: It's designed that way.

## The Facts:

### The Finances:

* Loan officers can make anywhere from $1,000 to upwards of **$30,000** on a single loan. A broker like myself  who carries 
all of his own costs, makes around $10,000 on a 500k loan and that's after tax assuming there is no discount. 
Realtors will make anywhere from 0.5% to 4% per loan. That's easily 10's of thousands of dollars on a single transaction. 


### Prior Education, Prior Experience, On the Job Education and Resources:

* For 99% of brokerages. 0.  

### Competition: 

* Impossibly high. Getting clients to do business with you is incredibly difficult. The average realtor closes in the low
single digit homes per year and the same goes for individual mortgage brokers. The places that do more volume typically 
pay substantially less. 
As of 2022-11-25 *<u>there are more Realtors, then there are homes for sale.</u>*

## What the Heck? 

What do you get with ( generally ) uneducated, high reward, low barrier to entry, low support jobs? 

Pure sales. The bad kind. The cartoon kind.  

You get desperation for business. This means the information given is highly biased towards gaining your business 
and not always your best intentions.

*Whatever that may take.* This includes outright lying, partial truths, exageration, dismissing real concerns, 
tomfoolery, bamboozling etc. Is this illegal? Maybe, but it's all very gray and happens every day.

Even if there are laws against providing bad or partial info very few loan officers or realtors 
follow them. It's just considered "sales". In under 5 minutes I can find you an illegally non compliant ad posted 
by either a realtor or a highly questionable "educational" post by someone who is not a licensed loan officer. 

It's possible to get an insanely low interest rate. Should I tell you that it might to cost you 4 [points](dictionary/point.md) to get that? 

Why should I give you accurate numbers when the guy next door is going to lie to you? You won't know they're bad
until the effort to switch lenders is too high and too late.

## Summary

The pressures and motivations towards being sh***y in this industry are incredibly high. When it's going well, there's 
little incentive to work hard for clients. When it's going poorly it's very very tempting to take the easy road of trickery.  

There is little to no education on how to do things at a high level. 

Doing things at a high level is very hard. Very few loan officers actually check all of the boxes. Very few realtors take 
that additional step to ensure the clients best interests.
