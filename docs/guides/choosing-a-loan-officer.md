## What Is Important

* Communication
    * Great LO's will answer the phone every time or text a heads up when they can call back. 
    * Questions are answered and not dismissed. No steam-rolling.
    * Respected yet given honest and clear expectations. There is no "fluff". It doesn't feel fake.
    * There is a plan moving forward. Certainty.

* Due diligence - Your LO catches any potential problems that can arise and warns you of them. They provide you 
with all the pieces of the puzzle as accurately as they can at that time. They are calculating everything upfront and 
not waiting till the end. They ask you for documents up front. 
Expectations are clear even when it may hurt your feelings.

* Insight - Your LO is able to provide you with potential alternative options you may not have thought about. Such as doing less than 20% down when you have great credit.

* An obvious high level knowledge of qualifications and guidelines. They are able to explain the "why" behind 
any reasoning. 

* They are willing to check all options. No putting you in a box unless clearly explained why. 

* You do not feel "sales'd". You should feel the same way when speaking to a doctor.  

## Why is this important?

<u>Most Loan Officers are bad.</u> This is unfortunately the truth. 
It is my opinion and subjective but I feel if you ask around you will arrive at this as well. 

#

It is not easy to be high level. 

When I say "bad" I don't mean intentionally bad, although there are certainly those as well, 
I mean they just don't know what they're doing. It's either lack of experience or lack of care since
it's worked out for them in the past. 

** I have worked with many Loan Officers that have been in the industry
for over a decade and are still awful at their job.**

They are simply salesmen. Sound great but minimal due diligence. 

Examples:

- Checking single entity ownership on a condo or at the minimum foreshadowing condo complications
- Checking if you meet the AMI when placed on a first time home buyer loan. 
- Understanding NALT guidelines and when you can get an exception on the 85% rule. 
- Declining, increasing or stable income such as overtime and how to increase the income when there is a gap. 
- Calculating accurate property taxes and checking for melo-roos in CA.

These are just a few examples that most Loan Officer's 
will not check **yet they are very common. ** All of these can be the difference in closing on your home. 

Although the job of a Loan Officer might seem simple, it is far from it. Unfortunately, a ton of mistakes can be made on a clean application, 
and the loan will still likely close.*   

You simply just pass the pain, confusion and anxiety off onto the customer later. 

***A good Loan Officer is sometimes indistinguishable from a bad one.***

## How Do I Pick Then? 

The same way you pick a doctor. You don't go to medical school to learn all the medical things just 
to pick the right doctor.

***You Can Feel It***

The same way you know stranger-danger. 

Some tips:

 - Reviews are nice, however they can be bought, read through them. Use your gut. 
 - Choose someone who understands your situation and the state you live in specifically. You can close 100+ conventional Loans and still botch 
 an FHA Loan easily. Guidelines vary between states as well.
 - Pick someone who is able to answer your questions efficiently or if they can't, they get the answer very quickly. Not all 
 things can be known at the time of the question but they also shouldn't be stumbling to answer basic ones.
 - Stay away from someone who dissmisses your concerns without an answer.
 - I don't have an opinion on Mortgage Broker vs Loan Officer or the size of the lender. The quality varies. I would lean towards broker 
 due to the transaction being more important to them and the fact that it normally takes longer to become a broker based on the state. 
 The hope being that longer time in lending equals more knowledge. This is not always true though and I have nothing to support that brokers are inherently better.

Best of luck!
