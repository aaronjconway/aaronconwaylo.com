## Step 1 - Financing

You guessed it! Speak to a <u>state licensed</u> Loan Officer (LO) or Broker.

Although you may be able to determine some of your qualifications such as [**DTI**](/docs/dictionary/dti) yourself, 

> **You don't know what you don't know.**

There are many factors that complicate the loan process besides the basic math. Choosing a great LO is fundamental 
to not just the experience but your home buying success. 

Read - [**How to Pick a Loan Officer**](/docs/guides/choosing-a-loan-officer)

May I ask? 

* Do you tie your shoes before you put them on? 
* Do you pour the milk before cereal? - <small>I will call the police</small>
* **Do you look at homes with a realtor before being approved?**

**<u><center>No. You do not.</center></u>**

I ask most of my clients the same question, 

> **Do you want me to say yes now, then no later?**

Everyone opts for certainty. Anything else is chaos. 

If you have questions on the type of approvals. Read - [**Pre-Qualified, Pre-approved? Verified? What are these?**]

### Objections to Step 1

* Assumption you're qualified - Rate Shopping at the pre approval stage. 

\**heavy sigh*\* let's say you are qualified. It would take many pages to go through all the possibilities on 
how you could be wrong. Don't be this person. Read - [**How And When To Shop For Mortgage Rates**](docs/guides/shop-for-rates)
There are no upsides to postponing the approval process and the consequences of being wrong are incredibly painful. 

* I Don't Want My Credit Pulled

Read - [The fear-mongering around credit inquiries.]

Do you maintain your car? Of course. You also have to use it to get from A to B. Same goes for your credit. You
have to use it to apply for financing. It is better to know for sure then to guess. 


## Step 2 - Find a home!

You have been qualified accurately from a solid LO! Woo! How exciting.

You are potentially only a few weeks from being in your
new home. Your LO has given you <u>good expectations</u>,
gone over a range of home prices and options you are qualified for, and you are comfortable with the financing. 

**<u>There is still some ambiguity</u>** on the exact monthly payment and out of pocket expense. Your LO can't predict the future. They can't give you 
an accurate rate, only a range. They can't give you an accurate closing cost estimate since we don't know which home we're buying. 
Some lenders, myself included, have a lock-and-shop option but it doesn't always
make sense. Even then I am still +- a few percent due to the unknown tax and insurance for that specific house. 

#### It is now time to find a realtor! 

You may use your own or your LO will have a recommendation.

Read - [The importance of choosing a good realtor ( a real life example )](https://google.com)

<img src="/img/trifecta.png" style={{width: 400}}/>

:::important
Make sure to keep your LO in the loop on the address's you plan on putting in an offer ***BEFORE*** you submit an offer. 
Your LO and your Agent are a nice little trifecta that need to be working together for success
:::


## Step 3 - Place the Offer

Again, before you place and offer make sure you review this property with your LO.

Your realtor will be in charge of writing of the offer. They will use personal 
experience of the area along comparable properties to determine what a good offer would look like. 

TODO
Read: How to make a good offer ( vetted by a realtor )

:::tip
Make sure they are working with your LO. The offer needs to be inline with your qualifications. The LO will
also have some advice that your realtor may not be aware of. **This could save you a substantial amount of money.**
:::

At this point your loan officer should be able to get you more accurate numbers.

**[As we discussed earlier](#oh-i-know-im-qualfied-i-just-want-the-best-rate), you are not shopping lenders at this point.** You have already chosen one that you
are comfortable with. Don't put yourself through that pain of switching lenders last minute. <u>It can cost you the home.</u>

This doesn't mean you should never switch lenders. By this stage you should have one you trust. 

## Step 4 - Offer accepted: Underwriting

Amazing! You are now under contract to purchase this home. 

There are many things that need to happen during this time. Don't be overwhelmed, you will be walked through this process if you
stay in contact with your realtor and lender. See the holy trinity picture above.  

Let's get to it!

1. You need to let your LO know the offer was accepted.
2. Complete the remainder of the loan application with the LO. This includes:

    * Sign the required disclosures. 
    * Provide any other documentation needed for underwriting. If you 
    TODO read my article on approvals you wont need very much here. 
    * Lock the interest rate for the next 30+ days while going toward closing.I personally 
    have not worked during a market where it made sense to float the rate. 
    * Submit the application to underwriting. 


3. The TODO appraisal order will be placed by your loan officer. Depending on the company 
you may or may not pay for it all up front. It will be credited towards your closing costs either way. 

4. Order a TODO home inspection. Your realtor should be able to assist with this. 

5. Deliver a check or wire the TODO Earnest Money to title.

6. Seek out a home owners insurance policy. 

7. Sit back and stay in communicaiton with your Realtor and lender!

## Step 5 - Moving towards Closing: Clear to Close

Almost there! 

A competent lender will have a conditional approval within the first week. Some are within the first 24hrs. These vary in quality but, in general, means that you are 
approved for financing. Please note this **IS NOT** a clear to close. The conditional part means that there
are still items needed by underwriting. 

Your responsibility at this stage is to be responsive and efficient in meeting these conditions. Examples would be 
explaining a large deposit, getting the declaration page for the home owners insurance policy, providing additional 
income documentation etc. 

Some of these will be outside of your immediate control but it is still your responsibility to work towards gathering these items.
Your LO will assist with any questions here.

Once these conditions are clear ( sometimes before ) you will recieve the initial closing disclosure (CD). This is typically when you would receive
a clear to close letter. The CD should be fairly close to your final numbers. The title company and lender will work on balancing the CD to make sure 
the numbers are correct for both parties. If anything changes you will recieve a redisclosure package with a summary.

:::caution
Please note - The initial closing disclosure is not always accurate.
A good loan officer should have been able to predict the majority of things that 
can change but some are outside of their control such as property taxes. Make sure you review and ask questions about things 
that might not make sense. It is possible for title or the Lender to make a mistake.
:::

After the CD is balanced, you'll be sent instructions on how and where to send the remainder of the downpayment
and closing costs. Next, you'll schedule a closing date.

## Step 6 - Closing day. 

You're now only a few hours away from being a home owner : ) 

On the day of closing you'll want to make sure a few things are checked off:

 - You have walked through the home and any repairs/condition is satisfactory
 - You have a valid photo id to bring to the closing table
 - **ALL** signers will be present. Confirm with your lender who needs to be present. 
 - You have already wired the money to closing or you have a check book ready to write a check. 
 
 :::caution
 Please make sure the funds you're going to be using for the closing wire/check are out of a source 
 the lender has already verfied. This **WILL** cause a delay if you use a source of funds we don't
 know about. 
 :::

You'll then attend the closing, sign the documents, record the transaction with the county and recieve your keys. 

Congratulaions! You've worked incredibly hard for this moment to happen. You are now a home owner and building wealth through realty.
