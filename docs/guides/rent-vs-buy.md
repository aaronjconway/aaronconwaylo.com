## The Obvious 

 - Potentially more space and peace. 
 - Potentially more privacy.  
 - Some of your money goes towards principle aka equity aka savings. 
 - Everything you fix adds real value to the home.
 - You're told that homes are good investments. 

## The Obvious But Not Talked About ( Fall 2022 )

- Your mortgage payment is almost certainly more than your rent. Potentially a freightening amount more.
- You're told homes are good investments but they are currently declining in value.
- You're told that it's always a good time to buy real estate but yeesh, have you seen the market? 

## The Unfortunate Truth 

Loan officers and your Realtor's are highly incentivised to tell you it's a good time.
This is touched on in [Why Loan Officer's Suck](docs/guides/loan-officers-suck.md) 


Even if they are right, they don't address the pain and pyschology of today's buyer. There is a blanket dismissive "it's always a good time to buy!"- \* in a 
a quivering voice \*  

You might be looking at 50+% more dollars per month to buy than to rent right now. 
***That's painful!*** 
* Yes, you build wealth when you look at it from a 5 year window. 
* Yes, you get all sorts of benefits you don't get while renting.

...but sheeeeesh. 

The dollars that you spend every month and the amount of money you have to spend on downpayment + closing costs, is buying a home worth it? 

It may not be. 

This is why it's so important to choose the right loan officer you can trust in. 
Not just a sales professional but someone that cares about your success and is able to break down the benefits
of homeownership. Someone that can pause and tell you that it may not be the right time. 

## Making a Decision.  

How can we decide it's a good time to buy? Let's look at some factors. I assume you've spoken to a licensed 
Loan Officer that's given you an accurate payment **with tax, insurance, applicable mortgage insurance, and home owners assocation dues.** 

* You are comfortable with the Mortgage payment and you are not liquidating every dollar you have. 
**You have a margin of error.**
* The proposed mortgage is anywhere close to your current rent payment.
* You are being forced to buy due to a life event. Family size, relocation etc. 
* You are a baller and have no budget. Over a very long term the math is very clear, you should buy a home. Since you 
are capable of fading any small term losses, buy a home. Sell, rent or refinance later.

## 1.75x Rule of Thumb.

In almost every scenario right now the monthly "pain" ( the dollars you will spend on a mortgage ) 
is higher than renting unless you have over 20% down.

What is very difficult to comprehend is the multi-variate equation of rent increase, 
average housing appreciation, the amount of principle you save with each payment, and what could have happened
if you had rented while saving excess money over time. 

It is not easy to calculate the long term benefits of buying a home. 

[Calculator is in developement. Please be patient]

Over a 5 year window, if rent increases as it always does and housing increases by it's normal amount as it always
has over long periods of time, 

> **you will end up with more equity in your home than if you had saved or invested that excess money while renting.**

The tough part is that this money is not *felt* it's hidden away. What is *felt*, is the extra dollars 
you spend every month on the mortgage, making it *feel* like a 
bad decision. 

If you rent is < 70% of the proposed mortgage payment ( this is the same as the mortgage being 1.5x the rent)

Then it may be best to hold for the next few months while following the plan shown below. 

## Bottom Line 

It makes sense to buy if you:

* A) Plan on holding the home over the next 5+ years
* B) Your proposed mortgage [PITIA](/docs/dictionary/piti)  is anywhere close to. 

Example 1: 2000/mo rent and the proposed mortgage is 3000/mo or less.

Example 2: 3000/mo rent and the proposed mortgage is 4500/mo or less. 

If this is not the case for you and you are uncomfortable with the current market I recommend that you: 

* Wait to see what happens over the next 6 months.
* Aggressively save money for when the time is right. 
* Speak with a loan officer on how you can better prepare for a new home

I hoped this help narrow down your decision!
