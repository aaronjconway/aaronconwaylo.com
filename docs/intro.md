:::caution
The information herein is not guarunteed to be complete or accuarate. 
There are too many combinations of loans, lenders, state laws, and the frequency that these change to account for. 

However, these articles are __only written by myself, a licensed and actively practicing loan officer.__ (<small>Unlike other places whose articles are <strong>not</strong> written by loan officers or even subject
matter experts. Yikes!</small>) I will do my absolute best to provide accurate information.

## Why This Site Was Created

This resource is developed to educate and provide realistic expecations in an effort to gain business
through transparency, integrity, and honesty.

Unfortunatley, there is a vast amount of information online whose quality and accuracy varies dramatically. With
such a large financial decision, this shouldn't be the case. Many clients feel they need to bear the burden of 
choosing the right loan becuase there's no one to trust. 

The problem is that the articles online are barely the tip of the information iceberg needed to accurately assess your mortgage
qualifications. 

>“The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, **it is the illusion of knowledge.**”
― Daniel J. Boorstin 

Although there are many established sites that seem to provide _good_ information, they tend to be lacking in a crucial area - reality.

Some examples: 

* conventional does go as low as 620 - this is almost never a good choice. 
* DPA - there is a real cost to this in terms of the monthly payment which isn't openly talked about. 
* The availability and stipulations tied to First Time Home Buyer programs.  

This website strives to provide the real truth on those scenarios so clients can have more 
confidence and reduce the chance of hearbreak later on.
