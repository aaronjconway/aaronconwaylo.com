## Why This Site Was Created

I developed this resource to educate and provide realistic expectations in an effort to gain business through transparency, integrity, and honesty.

Unfortunately, there is a vast amount of information online whose quality and accuracy vary dramatically.  Many clients have little trust with Loan Officers due to their poor historical reputation. 

One of the problems is that the articles online are barely the tip of the information iceberg needed to accurately assess your mortgage qualifications. This leads to,

>“The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, **it is the illusion of knowledge.**”
― Daniel J. Boorstin 

Although there are many established sites that seem to provide _good_ information, they tend to leave out crucial pieces that dramatically change the pricing or even if the loan is allowed. 

Some common examples seen online being only partially true: 

* Conventional loans do go as low as test - this is almost never a good choice when credit is below 680. The [cost](/dictionary/cost.md) is incredibly high. 
* DPA - Although this is sometimes a good option the monthly payment is considerably higher which isn't openly talked about.
* The availability and stipulations tied to First Time Home Buyer programs. 

This website strives to provide accurate and honest information to ensure that  good expectations are set. This will increase confidence and reduce the chance of heartbreak later on.
