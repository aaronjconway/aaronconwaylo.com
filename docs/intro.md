# Welcome!

This is everything I know pertaining to Homebuying and Mortgage Loans. 

These articles are currently __only written by me. An active practicing and licensed loan officer.__
This information is accurate and actionable to the best of my knowledge. 

<small>un-like some other places who's articles are <strong>not</strong> written by loan officers or even subject
matter experts. Yikes!</small>

Please be sure to double check this information with a licensed professional. 
I will attempt to reference any technical details.

:::caution
I thought I'd step in here and let you know, **THIS INFORMATION DOES NOT MAKE YOU A LOAN OFFICER.** Nor is this information guarunteed to be complete or accurate.
**DO NOT** go back to your loan officer with sass and use this against them. Are you right? Maybe. Is there
a nice and correct way of bringing that up? Yes. Are there exceptions and weird situations or things that 
maybe I don't know? Of course. Use good Judgment. Consult an expert

### Where Can I Go? 
 
There are three main categories in the side bar on the left.
If you are on mobile it will be in the menu button top left. 
* **Guides** - from the buying process to tying your shoes, we have it all. 
* **Things** - What the heck's a conventional loan? Click me!
* **Dictionary**- Too short for a thing. Banished to the Dictionary!

Use the search feature in the top right!
For you desktop nerds ` Ctrl+k` will open it for you.
