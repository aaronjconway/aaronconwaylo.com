## Why This Site Was Created

I developed this resource to educate and provide realistic expectations in an effort to gain business
through transparency, integrity, and honesty.

Unfortunately, there is a vast amount of information online whose quality and accuracy vary dramatically. With
such a large financial decision, this shouldn't be the case. Many clients feel they need to bear the burden of 
choosing the right loan and research themselves becuase of the reputation of Loan Officers.

The problem is that the articles online are barely the tip of the information iceberg needed to accurately assess your mortgage
qualifications. This leads to,

>“The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, **it is the illusion of knowledge.**”
― Daniel J. Boorstin 

Although there are many established sites that seem to provide _good_ information, they tend to be lacking in one crucial area - reality.

Some examples of major websites being only partially true: 

* conventional loans do go as low as 620 - this is almost never a good choice when credit is below 680
* DPA - there is a real cost to this in terms of the monthly payment which isn't openly talked about.
* The availability and stipulations tied to First Time Home Buyer programs.  

This website strives to provide the most accurate, no bologna, good expectation advice so clients can have more 
confidence and reduce the chance of hearbreak later on.
