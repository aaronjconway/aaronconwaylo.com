title: "Renting vs Buying: The Unspoken Factors"
---


## The Obvious 

 - Potentially more space and peace. 
 - Potentially more privacy.  
 - Some of your money goes towards principle aka equity aka savings. 
 - Everything you fix adds real value to the home.
 - You're told that homes are good investments. 

## The Obvious But Not Talked About ( Fall 2022 )

- Your mortgage payment is almost certainly more than your rent. Potentially a freightening amount more than your rent.
- You're told homes are good investments but they are currently declining in value.
- You're told that it's always a good time to buy real estate but yeesh, have you seen the market? 

## The Unfortunate Truth 

Loan officers and your Realtor's are highly incentivised to tell you it's a good time.

Read: Why Loan Officers and Realtors Suck. 

Even if they are right, they don't address the pain and pyschology of today's buyer. There is a blanket dismissive "it's always a good time to buy!"- \* in a 
a quivering voice \*  

You might be looking at 1000+ more dollars per month to buy than to rent right now. 
*That's painful!* Yes, you build wealth when you look at it from a 5 year window. Yes, you get all sorts of benefits you don't get while renting.

...but sheeeeesh. The dollars that you spend every month and the amount of money you have to spend on downpayment + closing costs, is buying a home worth it? 


It may not be. 

This is why it's so important to choose the right loan officer you can trust in. Not just a sales professional but someone that cares about your success.

## Making a Decision.  

How can we decide it's a good time to buy? Let's look at some factors. I assume you've spoken to a licensed 
Loan Officer that's given you an accurate payment. 

* You are comfortable with the Mortgage payment and you are not liquidating every dollar you have. You have a margin of error. 
* The mortgage is within 1.5x of your current rent payment. - Math up next 
* You have to buy due to a life circumstance. Family size, divorce, relocation of work etc. 
* You are a baller and have no budget.

## Math on 1.5x Rule of Thumb.

What I want everyone to understand is that yes, in almost every scenario right now your monthly "pain" ( the dollars you spend on your home/rent) 
is definitely higher than renting unless you have over 20% down.

What is very difficult to comprehend is the multivariate equation of rent increase, average housing appreciation, and the amount of principle you save
over time. You can't easily feel or calculate the long term benefits of buying a home. 

In all cases, over a 5 year window, if rent increases as it always does and housing increases by it's normal amount as it always
has over long periods of time, 

> you will end up with more equity in your home than if you had saved or invested that excess money while renting. 

This is on the assumption of normal investing, not speculative gambling such as crypto. 

The tough part is that this money is not "felt" it's hidden away. What is felt is the extra dollars you spend every month on the mortgage making it "feel" like a 
bad decision. 

If your rent is much less than ~70%% the future mortgage( the inverse of 1.5x rent ), In the short term, while home prices are still high along with interest rates, it may be best to hold. 

## Bottom Line 

It makes sense to buy if you:

* A) Plan on holding the home over the next 5+ years
* B) Your proposed mortgage with tax, and insurance is < 1.5x your current rent payment.

If this is not the case for you and you are uncomfortable with the current market I recommend that you: 

* Wait to see what happens over the next 6 months
* Aggressively save money for when the time is right. 
* Speak with a loan officer on how you can better prepare for a new home.

I hoped this help narrow down your decision!
