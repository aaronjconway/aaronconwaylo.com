title: Cost
description: "The common phrase for your out of pocket expense on a mortgage"

When the word "cost" comes up your Loan Officer is most commonly referring to the amount of finance charge or [Points](point.md) you'll have to pay to achieve what you're asking for. This will be a portion of the [Funds to Close](funds-to-close.md)

For example:

Loan Officer: "The cost will be very high" 
Translation:  The characteristics of this loan and what you're asking for are forcing the lender to charge you money in the form of [Points](point.md).

In Real life: 

You ask for a conventional loan but your credit is ~620-680. The lender, due to the higher risk, is going to charge you more which will increase the "cost" or total funds to close.
