A GSE is a business established to assist the general public created by congress. 

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are GSE's. 

Although privately held, they are able to function via goverment backing. When a loan meets the underwriting standard
of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac the goverment guaruntee's to purchase the loan which free's up money to provide more loans. 

Without them, at a certain point the funds for mortgage's would run out and no one would be able to get a loan until someone
else sold their home.
