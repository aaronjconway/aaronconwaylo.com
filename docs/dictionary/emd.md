title: Earnest Money Deposit (EMD)
---

Money that is deposited with a third party such as the escrow or title company to show good faith in carrying out the transaction. If you void your portion of the deal you can
potentially lose your emd. 

Losing EMD is very rare. There are many circumstances to back out of a purchase once under contract. 
This is covered in the [The Home Buying Process](/docs/guides/home-buying-process).

The EMD is wired or delivered by check typically within 72 hours or sooner from offer acceptance. 

It can range from 0 dollars to 5% of the purchase price with 1%-3% being the norm. 

## Example

500k house would require an EMD of 500,000*.003 = $15,000
