title: Point
---

A point is unit of cost based on the loan amount. Just like a dozen stands for 12, a point stands for a portion of the loan amount. 

One point equals 1% of the loan amount in cost. On a 400k loan, one point would be 4,000 dollars.

:::info
Almost all lenders advertise their rates WITH at least 2 points to acheive that rate.

## Translation:
* "That's going to be a lot of points" = That is going to cost you a lot of money. 
* "The cost is 2 points" = We are going to charge you 2% of the loan amount in the closing cost. 


On a 300k loan(not the purchase price, the loan)

> 2 points(2%) of 300k is the same as (0.02)*300,000 = 6,000 dollars. 

- 2 points on a 300k loan is 6,000 dollars
- 2 points on a 500k loan is 10,000 dollars
- 1 point on a 400k loan is 4,000 dollars
- 1.5 point on a 400k loan is 6,000 dollars

What is the point of life? You're askin' me man.
