A point is 1% of the loan amount.

EX: 2 points = 2%. 

On a 300k loan(not the purchase price, the loan)

> 2 points(2%) of 300k is the same as (0.02)*300,000 = 6,000 dollars. 

- 2 points on a 300k loan is 6000 dollars
- 2 points on a 500k loan is 10000 dollars
- 1 point on a 400k loan is 4000 dollars
- 1.5 point on a 400k loan is 6000 dollars

What is the point of life? You're askin' me man.
