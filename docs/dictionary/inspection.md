The inspection is typically very doom and gloom. It will be a comprehensive report on anything ranging from very minor to
uncovering large issues. 

It is stongly recommended you order an inspection. 

Finding issues with a home inspection doesn't mean you should back out of the home. These are items you can negotiate 
with the seller. A brand new home is still likley to come back with minor things on the inspection.  It is the inspectors
job to point out anything that could possibly be wrong. 

Inspections are different from [**Appraisals**](appraisal)
