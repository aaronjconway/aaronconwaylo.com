## What the heck does conventional even mean? 

Conventional just means it's not directly created by the goverment.

Back in the day, it was - "the convention". 

Don't get tied up on if it's better or worse. If it makes sense for you, great, but keep your mind
open based on the input from your Loan Officer. 

There are many types of conventional loans. 

## Conforming vs Non-Conforming. 

Conforming - Follows( conforms to) the underwriting guidelines of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

Non-Conforming - Aka Non-QM(Non Qualified mortgage). These do not follow Fannie/Freddie. 
This is typically when you need some leeway/exception such as a bank-statement loan. 

## First Time Home Buyer (FTHB)

There are a few FTHB conventional loans. Please be aware that your state may have additional programs
that I'm not aware of. Utah comes to mind. The three following loans have specific conditions but will be available by nearly all lenders/brokers

A FTHB is defined by someone who has not owned or on title of a home in the past three years. 

* [Homeready](https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/originating-underwriting/mortgage-products/homeready-mortgage)
* [Home Possible](https://sf.freddiemac.com/working-with-us/affordable-lending/guide-to-home-possible-mortgage?gclid=CjwKCAiApvebBhAvEiwAe7mHSN_u7kh_ziOwnkyDAvDJgUqI191Al1q1zLDbsR4-6iIq8zjRjKi0VRoCz14QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
* ["DU 97 - Home One"](https://sf.freddiemac.com/working-with-us/origination-underwriting/mortgage-products/home-one)

There are two main buckets that will allow you to get one of these loans.

* You make under the 80% Area Median Income [Lookup here](https://ami-lookup-tool.fanniemae.com/amilookuptool/)
* First Time Home Buyer. 

If you make under the 80% AMI(on your base pay, bonus/commision/overtime can be excluded assuming you still qualify), 
you do not need to be a FTHB. You are more likely to get the rate/cost credit as well. 
If you exceed the AMI but are a FTHB, you may get the ability to buy a home with 3% down, but will not get the credit.

The credit is not massive. Don't fret. It's simply a nice boost for people who are not making a ton of money. 

Pro's

* Allowed to do as low as 3% down. 
* Mortgage insurance is less
* Better pricing in comparison to a standard conventional loan.

Chat with your Loan Officer if one of these makes sense for your situation. 

## Non-QM

These are ok temporary solutions or for very specialized soltuions for 
high level investors that understand the risk.

:::caution
These will be very expensive. As of December 2022 any of these loans will range from 8 to 12 percent and will cost several [Points](../point)
We'll go over scenario's when this makes sense as there are some.
:::

* Bank Statement Loan - qualify with the average of your bank statements over the last 12 months. Slightly better pricing if 24 months
* Qualify with recent Foreclosure or Bankruptcy
* DSCR - (debt service coverage ratio) based on the proposed rent from the home. Investement only. 
* 1099 - based on 1099 income with non standard history requirements
* No Income - Based on the property. Very large (30%+) down payment required. 
* Foreign National

General Requirements: 

* 20%+ down. Preferably 30%+. 
* 680+ credit. Prefeably 740+. There are options as low as 620 but boy-oh-boy are they gross. 

## High Balance

In some area's the TODO loan limit is increased above the national limit. This increased cap is called the high-balance limit. 

These loans are slightly different and the pricing is typically a bit worse.

One thing to note FTHB's will be forced to do 5% down instead of 3%. 

## Jumbo

Jumbo Loans are classified as a loan that exceeds the loan limit for the area.

They are considered Non-QM loans but becuase they more or less follow conventional guidelines, they are reasonably priced.

Jumbo Loans have their own set of underwriting guidelines so don't be suprised if there are rules that exclude you from being able 
to go Jumbo when you would be able to get a smaller loan. 

Logically, larger loans are more risk which makes sense why these will be more strict than standard conventional loans.

### Scenarios

These are ***SOME*** of the possible scenarios. Not all. Go consult your lender or call me : ) 


If you are a veteran you should be looking at the VA loan page. There is almost never a time to do a 
conventional loan as a veteran unless you already have one. 
In that case I have info for you, on the VA page : ) thank you for your service. 

These all assume you meet the debt to income requirement of 50%. Please be aware this is a hard limit and normally lenders like to 
stay below 45%. 

1. Credit > 720 with 20% - Normal Conventional loan. When you put more than 20% down
you don't get the FTHB option FYI. If you have excellent credit consider doing less than 
20% down if the payment is comfortable as the pmi will be very cheap. Cheaper than
the additional loan size.

2. Credit > 720 with 3%-20% down. One of the FTHB options mentioned earlier as you may get the credit depending on your qualifications. 
If you make too much money, a normal conventional loan would likely be the best. 

3. Credit < 680 and < 15% down. You should potentially consider FHA. Conventional loans
are risk based remember. They get exponentially more expensive as your credit decreases. This is a borderline scenario and you should 
discuss if it makes sense with your loan officer. 

4. Credit < 660. You should almost certainly not look at conventional loans unless your income is enough to do a 
15 year loan or your downpayment is in the 35%+ range. Both of those factors will offset the credit to the point where
a conventional loan makes sense and the loan will be reasonably priced. 

5. You do not qualify on standard means or have a derogatory credit factor such as a bankrupcty recently. AND you have already spoken
to multiple lenders who have turned you down. AND you have > 20% down. Non-QM may be a good option. If you have a very large 
downpayment and very good credit, they are much more attractive. At the time of writing this they will be roughly 8-12% and 2-3 points in cost.

6. You have and want to use 40% down. The credit really doesn't matter at this point. Need to be over 620 (there are exceptions). 
Normal conventional loan is the best option.
