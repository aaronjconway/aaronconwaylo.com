title: Debt to Income (DTI)
---

The debt to income ratio is calculated by taking your obligation to debt divided by your income.

Some clients are very easy to calculate and some have many many items that are too difficult to calculate on their own.
I recommend you have your credit pulled by a loan officer and have them calculate it for you. 

:::info
If you are self-employed or receive additional income such as bonus, commision or overtime you need to 
speak with a loan officer. There are many variables involved in accurately using this type of income besides the obvious.
:::

A debt obligation is something you can't back out of such as:

* credit cards
* Any kinds of loans
* Mortgage 
* Child-Support/Alimony
* Collections
* Tax liens

If you potentially could turn them off without a problem, they don't count such as:

utilities, phone bills, etc.

There are ways to exclude debts but please be aware there are many complications in doing so. It does not always work out this easily. 
I would ask my Loan Officer "Can any of these debts be excluded?"

Some examples include:

* a payment with less than 9 months left. 
* someone else makes the payment out of their own account for 12 consecutive months
* Authorized user account where you are not obligated. This is called a b-3 account. 
* Your business pays the debt out of business funds and you account for this on the taxes 

## Example

You make 4,000/mo pre-tax, a car loan for 200/mo and a 30/mo credit card. The mortgage payment your 
loan officer has calculated for you is roughly 1500 per month **WITH** tax, hazard insurance and mortgage insurance if
applicable
> (200+30+1500)/4,000 = .4325 = 43.25% 

Typical max limits ( these can be reduced based on other risk factors such as credit, reserves etc.)

* 50% for Conventional loans
* 60% for VA Loans
* 57% for FHA loans
* 45% for Jumbo loans
