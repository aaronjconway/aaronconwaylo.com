title: Debt to Income (DTI)
---

The debt to income ratio is calculated by taking your debts(obligations on the credit report) divided by your income.

Some are very easy to calculate and some have many many items that are too difficult to calculate on their own.
I recommend you have your credit pulled by a loan officer and have them calculate it for you. 

:::info
If you are self-employed or receive additional income such as bonus, commision or overtime you need to 
speak with a loan officer. There are many variables involved in accurately using this type of income.
:::

A debt obligation is something you can't back out of such as:

* credit cards
* Any kinds of loans
* Mortgage 
* Child-Support/Alimony
* Collections
* Tax liens

If you potentially could turn them off without a problem they don't count such as:

utilities, phone bills, etc.


## Example

You make 4,000/mo pre-tax, a car loan for 200/mo and a 30/mo credit card. The mortgage payment your 
loan officer has calculated for you is roughly 1500 per month **WITH** tax, hazard insurance and mortgage insurance if
applicable
> (200+30+1500)/4,000 = .4325 = 43.25%
