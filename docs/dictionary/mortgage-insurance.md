Mortgage insurance is most common in two situations; a conventional loan with less than 20% down and FHA loans.
There is no mortgage insurance on VA loans with no stipulations ( thank you for your service )
Jumbo loans have no mortgage insurance ( but they typically make it up in [points](point))

## Conventional Primary Mortgage Insurance (PMI)

The reason for mortgage insurance is the increased risk of providing a loan when you have less skin in the game. When you provide a smaller down payment the lender reduces their risk by charging you a monthly fee until the principal of the loan is 80% of the original appraised value. You can re-appraise the home under certain conditions as well. 

Since Conventional Loans are risk based, the mortgage insurance "rate" will also be risked based. The rates will range from 0.1%-0.7%. This is the annual amount you will pay in mortgage insurance. Paying more than this amount means you probably shouldnâ€™t be doing a conventional loan.

Mortgage insurance is based on the loan <b>NOT</b> the purchase price.
It is calculated by taking the PMI rate * loan amount / 12 = monthly pmi amount in dollars.

Example 1: Someone who places 18% down and has good credit ( 720+). Nearly the amount to remove mortgage insurance. They are likely to receive a very low mortgage insurance rate because the likelihood of them making it to the 20% equity requirement is very high and the risk of them not paying their loan is very low since they have so much skin in the game. I would guess their rate would be roughly 0.1%

Math: 400,000 loan * (0.1% which is 0.001 in decimal form) = $400 annually = $33/monthly. 

Example 2: Client places down 3% ( the minimum allowed on Conventional) and has ok credit of 700. This client is likely to have a mortgage insurance rate of roughly .5%. 
Math: 400,000 * .005 = 2000 yearly or 167 dollars per month in PMI.
