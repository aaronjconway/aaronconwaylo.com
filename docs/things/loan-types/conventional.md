### tl;dr

    If you have 720+ credit this is usually the best option. There are plenty of exceptions.

### What the heck does conventional even mean? 

You'll hear me say this often. Don't get tied up on words. Semantics are dumb. 

Although I don't like using negatives to describe something, 
conventional just means it's not through the goverment. Nothing more, nothing less. 

Back in the day, it was - "the convention". 

A "normal loan". 

There are many types:

### Conforming vs Non-Conforming. 

Conforming - Follows(conforms to) the underwriting guidelines of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. 

Non-Conforming - Aka Non-QM(non-qualified mortgage). These do not follow Fannie/Freddie. You need some leeway/exception such as a bank-statement loan. 

### First Time Home Buyer

There are a few first time home buyer conventional loans. Please be aware that your state may have additional programs
that I'm not aware of. Utah comes to mind. These loans have specific conditions but will be available by nearly all lenders/brokers

* [Homeready](https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/originating-underwriting/mortgage-products/homeready-mortgage)
* [Home Possible](https://sf.freddiemac.com/working-with-us/affordable-lending/guide-to-home-possible-mortgage?gclid=CjwKCAiApvebBhAvEiwAe7mHSN_u7kh_ziOwnkyDAvDJgUqI191Al1q1zLDbsR4-6iIq8zjRjKi0VRoCz14QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
* ["DU 97 - Home One"](https://sf.freddiemac.com/working-with-us/origination-underwriting/mortgage-products/home-one)

There are two main buckets. You do not need to be both (depends) 

* You make under the 80% Area Median Income [Lookup here](https://ami-lookup-tool.fanniemae.com/amilookuptool/)
* First Time Home Buyer

If you make under the 80% AMI(on your base pay, bonus/commision/overtime can be excluded assuming you still qualify), 
you do not need to be a first time home buyer. You are more likely to get the rate/cost credit as well. 
If you crush the AMI but are a FTHB, you get the ability to buy a home with 3% down, but will not get the credit.

The credit is not massive. Don't fret. It's simply a nice boost for people who are making a ton of money. 
We'll go over when this loan does or doesn't make sense on this page. 

### Types of Non-QM

This will eventually be it's own page. These are good temporary solutions or very specialized soltuions for 
high level investors that understand the risk.  

:::caution
These will be very expensive as you need additionaly leeway to get qualified. Visit the Scenarios on this page to see 
when this makes sense.
:::

* Bank Statement Loan - qualify with the average of your bank statements over the last 12 months. Slightly better pricing if 24 months
* Qualify with recent Foreclosure or Bankruptcy
* DSCR - (debt service coverage ratio) based on the proposed rent from the home. investement only. 
* 1099 - based on 1099 income only
* No Income - Based on the asset only
* Foreign National
* Jumbo


General Requirements: 

* 20%+ down. Preferably 30%+ there are no minimum down Non-qm loans
* 680+ credit. Prefeably 740+. There are options as low as 620 but boy-oh-boy. Just save your money or you need a very large down payment

### Scenarios

These are ***SOME*** of the possible scenarios. Not all. Go consult your lender or call me : ) 


If you are a veteran you should be looking at the VA loan page. There is almost never a time to do a 
conventional loan as a veteran unless you already have one. 
In that case I have info for you, on the VA page : ) thank you for your service. 

These all assume you meet the debt to income requirement of 50%. Please be aware this is a hard limit and normally lenders like to 
stay below 45%. 

1. Credit > 720 with 20% - Normal Conventional loan. When you put more than 20% down
you don't get the FTHB option FYI. If you have excellent credit consider doing less than 
20% down if the payment is comfortable as the pmi will be very cheap. Cheaper than
the additional loan size.

2. Credit > 720 with 3%-20% down. One of the FTHB options mentioned earlier as you may get the credit depending on your qualifications. 
If you make too much money, a normal conventional loan would likely be the best. 

3. Credit < 680 and < 15% down. You should potentially consider FHA. Conventional loans
are risk based remember. They get exponentially more expensive as your credit decreases. This is a borderline scenario and you should 
discuss if it makes sense with your loan officer. 

4. Credit < 660. You should almost certainly not look at conventional loans unless your income is enough to do a 
15 year loan or your downpayment is in the 35%+ range. Both of those factors will offset the credit to the point where
a conventional loan makes sense and the loan will be reasonably priced. 

5. You do not qualify on standard means or have a derogatory credit factor such as a bankrupcty recently. AND you have already spoken
to multiple lenders who have turned you down. AND you have > 20% down. Non-QM may be a good option. If you have a very large 
downpayment and very good credit, they are much more attractive. At the time of writing this they will be roughly 8-12% and 2-3 points in cost.

6. You have and want to use 40% down. The credit really doesn't matter at this point. Need to be over 620 (there are exceptions). 
Normal conventional loan is the best option.
