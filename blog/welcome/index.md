## New Beginnings

This is my first blog post. My first time writing since poorly drafted papers in college nearly a decade ago. 
I have started a new venture.
The allure of bigger bucks and more control led me to forego my salaried job and I'm starting to realize, maybe,
quitting to become a self-generated loan officer during one of the 
toughest housing markets *ever*, was not the greatest Idea. 

This game is hard. Annoyingly hard. Knock Knock

### Can't be that hard
I used to think it was a shoe in. I'm a nerd. How hard could it be? 

* Just build a website. 
* Just ___do___ marketing
* SEO? that's just a little text about your industry in the header
* Just manage your clients (getting clients will be easy duh)  
* Just learn all the small things on the fly.

Ez game right? [GG](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=GG) as my friend [Nathan](https://www.instagram.com/supranate/) would say.

### (Spoiler) I was wrong

Running your own business is incredibly difficult. Surprise!!! Both the Quantity and in-depthy-ness of knowledge
needed to be competitive, I vastly underestimated. 

I have been slaped firmly in the face with my favorite saying. 
> You don't know what you don't know

Now that we've rooted ourselves in despair, where do we go from here?

### Next Steps

I have decided I quite enjoy this hole that I've dug. It'll make a nice basement for the mansion I'm building. It is a clean slate. 
A place for me to implement and deliver on the items I have been complaining about in the loan industry over the past two years.

It is certainly not comfortable or easy, no great achievements are, but I'm moving forward.

I'm looking forward to blazing this trail of a new style of loan officer. 

* Bringing tools from the engineering world into lending to improve the home buying experience.
* Transparency. Honesty. The full truth and nothing but.
* Arming the homebuyer with accurate knowledge to bridge the gap between reality and what's advertised. 

This should be the standard, not the exception.
