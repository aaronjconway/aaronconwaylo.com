title: About Me

Obessed about doing things the right way.

Originally started out on the engineering path and eventually started my own business as a professional math and science tutor back in 2016. 

Although I didn't have any interest in the sales world I did find the problems presented in the mortgage industry to be very interesting. 
The Problems coupled with a customer service role I could out perform my peers in was inticing to me which led me to start at Rocket Mortgage. 
I was one of highest quality bankers there shown through the multiple awards and extensive customer reviews. 

I realized I could provide a better experience, better pricing all while making more income if I were to start my own business which led me to join 
with Nexa Mortgage. I am very grateful however for the experience and vast knowledge gained in such a short time while with Rocket. 

Since then I've been in Scottsdale, AZ working my butt off to create a product and service I'm proud to stand behind. 

My goal is to bring the tools and technology of the software engineering world into the mortgage arena to greatly enhance both
the customer and Loan Officer experience.
